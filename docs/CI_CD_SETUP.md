## Configuration Files

### GoReleaser (`.goreleaser.yaml`)

Comprehensive configuration for multi-platform builds and distribution:

- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows (amd64, arm64, 386, arm)
- **Archives**: Platform-specific archive formats (tar.gz, zip)
- **Checksums**: SHA256 verification files
- **Package Managers**: Homebrew, Winget, APT/RPM packages
- **Docker Images**: Container image publishing to GitHub Container Registry
- **Signing**: Cosign integration for artifact signing

### Linting (`.golangci.yml`)

Comprehensive linting configuration:

- **Enabled Linters**: errcheck, gosimple, govet, staticcheck, security checks
- **Code Quality**: Complexity analysis, function length limits
- **Security**: Gosec integration for vulnerability detection
- **Formatting**: Gofmt and goimports validation
- **Performance**: Inefficient code detection

### Configuration Management

Project configuration is handled through:

- **Environment Variables**: Runtime configuration via environment variables
- **Command Line Flags**: Per-operation configuration overrides
- **Default Settings**: Sensible defaults built into the application

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

Syncwright follows semantic versioning (SemVer):
- **Major**: Breaking changes
- **Minor**: New features (backward compatible)
- **Patch**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)
- **Prerelease**: alpha, beta, rc suffixes

### Version Script (`scripts/version.sh`)

Utility script for version management:

```bash
# Show current version
./scripts/version.sh current

# Show version information
./scripts/version.sh info

# Calculate next versions
./scripts/version.sh next patch
./scripts/version.sh next minor

# Validate version format
./scripts/version.sh validate v1.2.3
```

### Makefile Integration

Enhanced Makefile with CI/CD targets:

```bash
# Version management
make version           # Current version
make version-info      # Detailed information
make version-next      # Next possible versions

# Local CI pipeline
make ci-local          # Full local CI run
make check             # Quality checks
make test-coverage     # Test with coverage
make test-timeout      # Timeout and retry testing

# Workflow validation
make validate-workflows
make validate-action
```

## Release Process

### Automated Release (Recommended)

1. **Trigger Version Bump**:
   - Go to GitHub Actions â†’ "Version Bump" workflow
   - Select version type (patch/minor/major)
   - Choose prerelease options if needed
   - Run workflow

2. **Automatic Steps**:
   - Version calculation and validation
   - Git tag creation and pushing
   - Release workflow triggering
   - Binary builds and GitHub release creation
   - GitHub Marketplace publishing

### Manual Release

1. **Create and Push Tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Monitor Workflows**:
   - Release workflow triggers automatically
   - Monitor job progress in GitHub Actions
   - Verify release creation and marketplace publishing

## GitHub Marketplace

### Publishing Configuration

The action is automatically published to GitHub Marketplace when:
- A stable release (non-prerelease) is created
- `action.yml` contains proper marketplace metadata
- All validation checks pass

### Marketplace Metadata

Key metadata in `action.yml`:
- **Name**: Clear, descriptive action name
- **Description**: Detailed functionality description
- **Author**: Author information
- **Branding**: Icon and color for marketplace display

### Major Version Tags

Major version tags (v1, v2) are automatically maintained:
- Updated on each stable release
- Allow consumers to use `@v1` for latest v1.x.x
- Provide stability and easy updates

## Security Considerations

### Permissions

Workflows use minimal required permissions:
- **contents: write**: For release creation and tag pushing
- **packages: write**: For container image publishing
- **pull-requests: write**: For PR comments and labels

### Secrets Management

Required secrets:
- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Automatically provided (releases, marketplace)
- **CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN**: Optional for AI-powered testing

### Security Scanning

Multiple security layers:
- **Gosec**: Go security vulnerability scanning
- **Workflow Analysis**: GitHub Actions security review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability checks
- **SARIF Integration**: Security findings uploaded to GitHub Security tab

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Workflow Status

Monitor workflow execution:
- GitHub Actions tab shows all workflow runs
- Step-by-step execution logs
- Artifact downloads for build outputs
- Test results and coverage reports

### Common Issues

1. **Version Validation Failures**:
   - Ensure semantic version format (vX.Y.Z)
   - Check for duplicate tags
   - Validate git repository state

2. **Build Failures**:
   - Check Go module dependencies
   - Verify cross-compilation compatibility
   - Review build logs for specific errors

3. **Marketplace Publishing Issues**:
   - Validate action.yml metadata
   - Ensure stable release (not prerelease)
   - Check marketplace guidelines compliance

4. **Timeout and Retry Issues**:
   - Verify network connectivity and API availability
   - Check timeout configuration in action inputs
   - Validate retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Monitor resource usage during extended operations

### Debug Resources

- **Workflow Logs**: Detailed execution information
- **Step Summary**: High-level status and results
- **Artifacts**: Download build outputs and reports
- **Local Testing**: Use `make ci-local` for local validation

## Local Development

### Setup

```bash
# Install development tools
make dev-setup

# Run local CI pipeline

```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
